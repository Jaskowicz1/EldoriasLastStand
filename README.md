# Eldoria's Last Stand
 The code for my uni project made in Unreal Engine 5!
 
 You can find more information about this project over at the [Project Page](https://jaskowicz.xyz/Projects/EldoriasLastStand).

 This code will not work on it's own. It needs Unreal Engine 5 to work, along with needing other information passed through.

## What was used for this?
 - Unreal Engine 5
 - Jetbrains Rider (C++)

## Other information

 This code could be heavily improved, for starters the stats component could have just used Gameplay Tags rather than set variables for each stat (which was silly because I was using Gameplay tags for other things, I just overlooked this). However, I'm still extremely proud of myself as this was my first project where nearly everything was in C++ (apart from widgets and small gameplay trigger boxes).
